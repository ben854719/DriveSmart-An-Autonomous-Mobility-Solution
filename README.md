# Drive Smart An Autonomous Mobility Solution

#  Objective:

This initiative leverages a Bluetooth enabled applcation for secure, remote activation of autonomous vehicles using encrypted biometric authentication via PySyft, delivering over 98% accuracy across varied environments. PyTorch powers high-precision anomaly detection (95%), validated through analysis of 10,000+ sensor inputs to identify early-stage faults. Real-time diagnostics, refreshed every 5 seconds and paired with sub-second error classification, are visualized through dynamic Plotly dashboards. Agentic AI supports multilingual reporting in English, French, and Spanish, achieving over 97% translation accuracy across more than 50 operational scenarios.
